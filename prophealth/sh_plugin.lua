Prop Health Plugin for Helix

This lightweight plugin adds a dynamic health and destruction system to all physics props.

Features:

    - Mass-Based Health: A prop's maximum health is automatically calculated based on its physical weight (Mass * Config Multiplier). Heavier objects like concrete barriers are much harder to destroy than wooden crates.

    - Explosive Destruction: When health reaches zero, the prop creates an explosion effect before being removed. **Can be Disabled**

    - Real-Time Tooltip: Looking at a prop displays a live health counter in the standard Helix interaction menu that updates instantly during combat.

Configuration: You can adjust 'propsMinHP' (default 50) and 'propsHPMultiplier' (default 5) in your server configuration to balance durability.

*AI usage note: Code quality impromevents.*
